# DebugLogger
A very simple class thats prints only In debug mode and not in release

Usage:- 

```
Logger.printValue("anything you type here will only appear in debug mode")

```
And the output is 

```
DriverInformationPresenter.swift:["anything you type here will only appear in debug mode"]
```

here DriverInformationPresenter is the file from which you wrote the print command.
